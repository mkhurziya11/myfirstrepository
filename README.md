# Vignere Cypher
## A cypher that encrypts a message
The first step to a vignere cypher is to input a plaintext, or in other words, the phrase you want to encode. Next, you need to input a key, which will later be expanded/reduced to the length of the plaintext. The true cypher process occurs with a table, similar to what you would see in a 12x12 multiplation sheet. On the columns, you look for the letters in the plaintext and in the rows you find the letters of the keystream, with each pair having a specfic letter association.
